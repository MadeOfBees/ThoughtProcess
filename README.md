## Description: 
 A simple social media backend with support for comments and reactions 

## Installation/Instructions: 
 I don't recomend ever using this but if you wanted to for some reason you'd download the repo, run NPM i, npm start then 
 Use insomnia to add some users, then you can make posts as said users, and then react to those.
