## Description: 
 A simple social media backend with support for comments and reactions 

## Installation/Instructions: 
 I don't recomend ever using this but if you wanted to for some reason you'd download the repo, run NPM i, npm start then log into Insomnia to make posts/users, etc. 
 Use insomnia to add some users, then you can make posts as said users, and then react to those.
